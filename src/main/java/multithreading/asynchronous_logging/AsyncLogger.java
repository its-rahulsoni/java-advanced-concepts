         * method signature matches.
         *

         * public interface Runnable {
         *     void run();
         * }
         *

         * loggerExecutor.submit(this::consumeLogs);
         *
         * Into something like:
         * loggerExecutor.submit(new Runnable() {
         *     public void run() {
         *         consumeLogs();
         *     }
         * });

         * loggerExecutor.submit(() -> consumeLogs());

         * ðŸš« Calling consumeLogs() Directly
         * If you write:
         * consumeLogs();
         *
         * You're simply calling the method in the main thread (or whatever thread instantiated the object). That means:
         *
         * 1. The main thread will block and run the consumeLogs() method.
         *
         * 2. If consumeLogs() is a long-running or infinite loop (like in an async logger), your application may hang or become unresponsive.
         *
         * 3. It defeats the purpose of making logging asynchronous.
         *
         * âœ… Using loggerExecutor.submit(this::consumeLogs);
         *
         * This:
         * loggerExecutor.submit(this::consumeLogs);
         *
         * 1. Submits the method to a background thread, separating log consumption from the main flow.
         *
         * 2. Allows your main application to continue running while log entries are processed in parallel.
         *
         * 3. Is non-blocking to the constructor or caller.
         *
         * 4. Enables asynchronous logging, which improves performance and responsiveness.
         *
         * ðŸ“Œ Analogy
         * Think of:
         *
         * 1. consumeLogs() as a waiter refilling glasses.
         *
         * 2. submit(this::consumeLogs) as assigning that task to a new staff member (thread).
         *
         * 3. consumeLogs() directly â€” you're doing the refilling yourself and stopping everything else.
