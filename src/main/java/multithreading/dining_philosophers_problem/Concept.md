## 🍽️ Dining Philosophers Problem

---

### 📘 Problem Definition

The **Dining Philosophers Problem** is a synchronization problem that demonstrates challenges of **deadlock**, **resource sharing**, and **starvation** in concurrent programming.

* You have `N` philosophers sitting around a table.
* Each philosopher alternates between **thinking** and **eating**.
* Between each pair of philosophers is a **single fork**.
* To eat, a philosopher needs **both the left and right fork**.
* Only one philosopher can use a fork at a time.

### 🎯 Goals

* Avoid **deadlocks** (where every philosopher holds one fork and waits).
* Avoid **starvation** (where some philosophers never get to eat).
* Ensure **maximum concurrency** where possible.

---

### ❗ Challenges

* Each philosopher is a thread.
* Shared forks are limited resources.
* Naively grabbing both forks can lead to deadlock.

---

### 🔧 Concepts Used

* `Semaphore` or custom locking mechanism.
* Smart ordering or timeout strategies to prevent deadlock.
* `synchronized`, `ReentrantLock`, or `Semaphore` usage.

---

### 🔄 Example with 5 Philosophers & 5 Forks

* **5 philosophers**, each needs **2 forks** (left and right) to eat.
* **5 forks** total, one between each pair.
* Each philosopher:

    * Thinks 💭
    * Tries to pick up **left fork** 🔗
    * Tries to pick up **right fork** 🔗
    * Eats 🍝
    * Puts down both forks

## 💥 The Deadlock Situation

Let’s say **all 5 philosophers** do this **at the same time**:

1. P0 picks up left fork (F0)
2. P1 picks up left fork (F1)
3. P2 picks up left fork (F2)
4. P3 picks up left fork (F3)
5. P4 picks up left fork (F4)

Now, **no one can pick up their right fork** because:

* P0 needs F1 (held by P1)
* P1 needs F2 (held by P2)
* ...
* P4 needs F0 (held by P0)

**All are blocked → DEADBLOOOCK.** 😱
No one can eat, no one can proceed.

## 🛡️ How Semaphore(4) Solves It

```java
private final Semaphore room = new Semaphore(4);
```

This limits the **maximum number of philosophers who can enter the “dining room” at once to 4**, **not all 5**.

### ✅ Key Idea:

If only 4 philosophers are allowed to pick up forks at the same time, **at least one fork will always be free**.

This means:

* At least one philosopher will be able to pick up **both forks** and eat.
* Once they’re done, they release both forks.
* Now another philosopher can proceed.
* **Deadlock is avoided.**

## 📊 How It Works in Practice

| Component        | Purpose                                                                |
| ---------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `forks[]`        | Each fork is a binary semaphore (only one philosopher can hold it).    |
| `room` semaphore | Limits to 4 philosophers to avoid circular wait (deadlock prevention). |
| `acquire()`      | Tries to pick up a fork (blocking if unavailable).                     |
| `release()`      | Puts the fork back after eating.                                       |


So the sequence is:

1. Philosopher checks if they’re allowed to enter (via `Semaphore room`).
2. If allowed, they proceed to pick up forks and eat.
3. When done, they release the permit and forks.
4. Another philosopher can now enter.

## 🔄 Why 4 and not 3?

Even 2, 3, or 4 philosophers would prevent deadlock.

But:

* With 4 philosophers allowed at a time:

    * You minimize the chance of idle philosophers (maximize concurrency).
    * Still avoid deadlock.
* With all 5 → you risk deadlock.

So **4 is a good safe upper bound** that balances:

* 🔐 **Safety** (no deadlock)
* ⚡ **Concurrency** (as many as possible eat simultaneously)

## 🧠 Summary

| Without Semaphore              | With `Semaphore(4)`                    |
| ------------------------------ | -------------------------------------- |
| All 5 philosophers grab 1 fork | Only 4 can enter and grab forks        |
| Everyone waits for 2nd fork    | At least one can eat and release forks |
| 💥 Deadlock possible           | ✅ Deadlock prevented                   |
