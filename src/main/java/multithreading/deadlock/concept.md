Great! Let's dive into **Problem #4: Deadlock and its Prevention** ‚Äî a classic issue in multithreaded programming.

---

## üß® What is Deadlock?

A **deadlock** occurs when two or more threads are **waiting on each other** to release resources ‚Äî and none of them ever proceed. This causes a **complete standstill** in the system.

---

### üéØ Real-World Analogy

Imagine:

* Two people are writing a report together.
* Person A has the pen ‚úèÔ∏è but needs the notebook üìí.
* Person B has the notebook üìí but needs the pen ‚úèÔ∏è.
* Both wait for the other to release what they need.

Result? **Neither can proceed = Deadlock!**

---

## üßµ Programming Version

In Java, this often happens when threads **lock multiple shared resources** (e.g., synchronized blocks) in **different orders**.


---

## ‚ö†Ô∏è What Happens?

* `Thread 1` acquires `Lock1`, then waits for `Lock2`.
* `Thread 2` acquires `Lock2`, then waits for `Lock1`.
* **Both threads are stuck forever.**

Output might look like:

```
Thread 1: Holding Lock1...
Thread 2: Holding Lock2...
Thread 1: Waiting for Lock2...
Thread 2: Waiting for Lock1...
```

‚Ä¶and then nothing. Deadlock.

## ‚úÖ Deadlock Prevention Strategies

### 1. **Always Lock Resources in the Same Order**

Ensure all threads acquire multiple locks in **the same order**.

```java
// Both threads should lock Lock1 first, then Lock2
```

### 2. **Use Try-Lock with Timeout (java.util.concurrent.locks)**

Use `ReentrantLock.tryLock()` to avoid waiting forever.

```java
ReentrantLock lock1 = new ReentrantLock();
ReentrantLock lock2 = new ReentrantLock();

if (lock1.tryLock(1, TimeUnit.SECONDS)) {
    if (lock2.tryLock(1, TimeUnit.SECONDS)) {
        // Work with both resources
        lock2.unlock();
    }
    lock1.unlock();
}
```

### 3. **Use a Global Lock Manager**

Use a higher-level mechanism (like a resource allocator) to manage lock acquisition and prevent circular waits.

### 4. **Avoid Nested Locks**

Try to keep your design such that threads don't need to acquire more than one lock at a time.

| Prevention Technique  | Description                                      |
| --------------------- | ------------------------------------------------ |
| Lock Ordering         | Always lock resources in a fixed global order    |
| Try-Lock with Timeout | Use `tryLock()` to avoid indefinite blocking     |
| Lock Manager          | Use a centralized controller for resource access |
| Avoid Nested Locks    | Minimize complexity by avoiding multiple locks   |
